Project 1

I completed the following bells/whistles:
-Bell: Tooltips
-Bell: Xs and Ys
-Bell: Styling your Visualization --> I stylized the page to have CU theme
-Bell: Best Fit Lines
-Whistle: Replication
--> I replicated the visualizations in Tableau. I had to play around with the various options to try to get the visualizations to look as close as possible to those made using d3. In general, Tableau did not provide much flexibility to customize the graphs. I found it easier to make a generic graph in Tableau, but I found it easier to make the specific graph I wanted in d3.

I didn't work with anyone in class on this project.

I used the following resources for guidance:
